# Made Movement Code Test
- In this repo you should find everything you need to build our test project.
- There is a PSD and PDF of the design in the `design` folder.
- All necessary images can be found in the `images` folder.
- Feel free to make the Header Background, the Hamburger Menu, and the Submit Button from CSS instead of images if you would like.
- The font is called `Merriweather` and can be found on `Google Fonts`. You will need `regular` and `bold`.
- We have only included a mobile design. Please use your best judgment, and build the site responsively.
